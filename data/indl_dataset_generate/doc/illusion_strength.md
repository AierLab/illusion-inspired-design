# Normalized Perceptual Distortion Metrics for Visual Illusions

## Standard Metrics for Illusion “Strength” in Research

Researchers typically quantify the *magnitude* or *strength* of a visual illusion by measuring how much the physical stimulus must be altered to cancel out the illusion. In psychophysics, the **point of subjective equality (PSE)** is often used: this is the point where a viewer perceives two stimuli as equal despite a physical difference ([
            The BTPI: An online battery for measuring susceptibility to visual illusions - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484025/#:~:text=The%20classic%20psychophysical%20method%20of,current%20study%2C%20to%20provide%20a)). The required physical difference at the PSE (relative to the true equal stimulus) represents the illusion’s magnitude ([
            The BTPI: An online battery for measuring susceptibility to visual illusions - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484025/#:~:text=The%20classic%20psychophysical%20method%20of,current%20study%2C%20to%20provide%20a)). For example, if one line must be 10% longer than another for them to **appear** equal, the illusion causes a 10% perceptual distortion. Illusion strength can thus be expressed as a normalized ratio (e.g. 0.10 in this case). By normalizing to a 0–1 scale, **0** indicates no distortion (veridical perception) and **1** indicates an illusion at a reference maximum strength (often the strongest typical distortion observed for that illusion).

Psychophysical methods for measuring illusions include the **method of adjustment** (subjects adjust a stimulus until a perceptual match is achieved) and **constant stimuli or forced-choice methods** (to find PSE and just-noticeable differences via psychometric curves) ([
            The BTPI: An online battery for measuring susceptibility to visual illusions - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484025/#:~:text=The%20classic%20psychophysical%20method%20of,current%20study%2C%20to%20provide%20a)). Different methods generally agree on relative illusion strength ([
            Individual differences in the perception of visual illusions are stable across eyes, time, and measurement methods - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8164370/#:~:text=match%20at%20L191%20two%20illusion,eyes%2C%20time%2C%20and%20measurement%20methods)). Researchers sometimes report illusion magnitude in absolute units (e.g. degrees, millimeters) or as a percentage of the reference stimulus ([Frontiers | Quantifying the Ebbinghaus figure effect: target size, context size, and target-context distance determine the presence and direction of the illusion](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01679/full#:~:text=illusion%20magnitude%2C%20the%20perceptual%20distinctiveness%2C,psychophysical%20and%20motor%20control%20studies)). To enable comparison across illusions, it is useful to convert these measures to a common normalized scale (0 to 1) representing the fraction of perceptual distortion. Below, we review how various classic illusions can be quantified and propose a normalized **“illusion strength”** metric for each, based on perceptual distortion rather than raw physical differences.

## Algorithms for Illusion Strength by Illusion Type (Normalized 0–1)

### Hering and Wundt Illusions (Distorted Line Curvature)  
**Description:** In the Hering illusion, two straight parallel lines placed over a background of radiating lines appear bowed outward. The Wundt illusion is the inverse configuration (radiating lines inward) causing lines to appear bowed inward. Both are distortions of perceived **straightness/curvature** caused by a background pattern of intersecting lines. 

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** We measure how much curvature must be added to the lines to nullify the illusion. Observers can adjust the lines to be slightly curved (concave or convex) until they *appear* straight ([Poggendorff illusion | psychology | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/Poggendorff-illusion#:~:text=The%20Poggendorff%20illusion%20depends%20on,Ponzo%20illusion%2C%20seems%20larger%20than%E2%80%A6)). The required curvature (angle deviation) is the illusion’s magnitude. For example, if a physically straight line looks maximally bowed by about 1° due to the radiating background, adding a 1° opposite curvature would straighten its appearance. We normalize illusion strength as: 

$$\text{Illusion Strength} = \frac{\text{Apparent curvature deviation}}{\text{Maximum curvature needed for a straight percept}}$$

By definition, this yields 1.0 for the curvature needed to fully cancel the effect (e.g. a line curved 1° opposite to the Hering distortion now appears straight corresponds to strength ~1.0). If no adjustment is needed (lines were perceived straight as-is), strength = 0. Empirically, Hering/Wundt distortions are moderate; the radiating lines might induce a curvature on the order of a fraction of a degree, so typical strength values might be in the 0.2–0.5 range under standard conditions. The measure focuses on perceived distortion (curvature) rather than any direct geometric difference in the stimulus (since physically the lines remain straight in the original illusion).

**Heuristic Algorithm:** 
1. Present the illusion (parallel lines over radiating pattern). 
2. Let the observer adjust the curvature of the test lines (or use a computational model to find when lines *would* appear straight). 
3. Compute the angular curvature (or separation difference) required to subjectively straighten the lines – e.g. if lines must bend inward by 0.5° to counter an outward bulge illusion, record 0.5°. 
4. Normalize this by a reference value (e.g. if 2° curvature is considered a “full” effect based on an extreme-case configuration, then 0.5°/2° = 0.25). 

This yields a dimensionless illusion strength score between 0 (no bowing perceived) and 1 (strongest typical bowing). Validation can be done by verifying that this score correlates with observers’ error in judging the lines’ straightness under various background angles and spacings.

### Müller–Lyer Illusion (Arrow Line Length)  
**Description:** The Müller–Lyer illusion consists of a line with inward or outward fins (“arrowheads” vs “feathers”). A line with outward fins (feather tails) looks longer than an identical line with inward fins (arrowheads). The distortion is in **perceived length** ([
            The BTPI: An online battery for measuring susceptibility to visual illusions - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484025/#:~:text=The%20classic%20psychophysical%20method%20of,current%20study%2C%20to%20provide%20a)).

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** The classic measure is how much one must adjust the line length to compensate for the fins. Using a method of adjustment, observers change one line until the two lines *appear equal* ([
            Individual differences in the perception of visual illusions are stable across eyes, time, and measurement methods - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8164370/#:~:text=size%20of%20a%20target%20to,left%20quadrant%20to%20match)) ([
            Individual differences in the perception of visual illusions are stable across eyes, time, and measurement methods - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8164370/#:~:text=participants%20adjusted%20the%20size%20of,2%7D%20for%20gray%2C%20146)). The *illusion magnitude* is the percentage length difference at the PSE. For instance, if a 100 mm line with outward fins looks equal in length to a 110 mm line with inward fins, the illusion causes a 10% length distortion. We define: 

$$\text{Illusion Strength} = \frac{|\text{PSE length difference}|}{\text{true length}} \times \frac{1}{0.20}$$

Where 0.20 represents the maximum typical effect (20% length misjudgment). The equation can be simplified as:

$$\text{Illusion Strength} = \frac{|L' - L|}{L \times 0.20}$$

Where L is the baseline physical length and L' is the length needed for perceptual equality.

In the above example, strength ≈ +0.10/0.20 = 0.5 for the observer (the line with fins-outward was overestimated by 10%). Typically, Müller–Lyer illusions in adults can produce about a 10–20% misjudgment under optimal conditions ([The influence of Müller-Lyer illusion on length assessment: The alternative way of measuring the strength of the illusion](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387413454_The_influence_of_Muller-Lyer_illusion_on_length_assessment_The_alternative_way_of_measuring_the_strength_of_the_illusion#:~:text=experiments%2C%20the%20method%20of%20two,pass%20chromatic%20filters)). To normalize on 0–1, we can set 1.0 as the magnitude observed with a strong fin angle and length (say ~20% in a high-contrast, isoluminant display ([The influence of Müller-Lyer illusion on length assessment: The alternative way of measuring the strength of the illusion](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387413454_The_influence_of_Muller-Lyer_illusion_on_length_assessment_The_alternative_way_of_measuring_the_strength_of_the_illusion#:~:text=experiments%2C%20the%20method%20of%20two,pass%20chromatic%20filters))). Thus a 10% illusion would be 0.5 on this scale. 

**Proposed Algorithm:** 
- Determine the *baseline* physical length \(L\) of the reference segment. Have the observer (or a model) adjust the comparison segment length \(L'\) until both appear equal. 
- Compute \( \Delta L = |L' - L| \). The *relative distortion* = \( \Delta L / L \). For example, if \(L=50\) mm and the observer sets \(L'=55\) mm for equality, \(\Delta L/L = 5/50 = 0.10\). 
- Normalize by a typical maximum (e.g. 0.20). In this example, normalized strength = 0.10/0.20 = **0.5**. 

This approach captures perceived distortion (the extra length needed for a match) rather than just geometric difference. It aligns with how illusion susceptibility is defined in vision science ([
            The BTPI: An online battery for measuring susceptibility to visual illusions - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484025/#:~:text=The%20classic%20psychophysical%20method%20of,current%20study%2C%20to%20provide%20a)). Validation can involve checking that this measure predicts an observer’s error in other tasks, and verifying known effects: for instance, the strength increases for more acute fin angles and at isoluminance (e.g. up to ~1.5–2× stronger with color-only cues) ([The influence of Müller-Lyer illusion on length assessment: The alternative way of measuring the strength of the illusion](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387413454_The_influence_of_Muller-Lyer_illusion_on_length_assessment_The_alternative_way_of_measuring_the_strength_of_the_illusion#:~:text=experiments%2C%20the%20method%20of%20two,pass%20chromatic%20filters)).

### Poggendorff Illusion (Misaligned Transverse Line)  
**Description:** In the Poggendorff illusion, a diagonal line segment is interrupted by two parallel lines (often a rectangle). The continuation of the diagonal on the other side appears laterally offset (misaligned) from the first segment ([The Poggendorff illusion driven by real and illusory contour](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393216300677#:~:text=The%20Poggendorff%20illusion%20refers%20to,the%20diagonal%20line%20is)). The distortion is in **perceived alignment/position** of the line’s continuation.

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** We quantify how much we must shift the second segment to be seen as truly collinear with the first. In experiments, observers adjust the alignment of the continuation until it *appears* straight through ([
            Individual differences in the perception of visual illusions are stable across eyes, time, and measurement methods - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8164370/#:~:text=segment%20to%20match%20the%20length,2%7D%20for%20gray%2C%20146)) ([
            Individual differences in the perception of visual illusions are stable across eyes, time, and measurement methods - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8164370/#:~:text=length%20of%20the%20upper%20horizontal,2%7D%20for%20gray%2C%20146)). The needed offset (as a fraction of the spacing between the parallels) is the illusion's strength. For example, suppose the two parallel lines are 50 mm apart, and the continuation needs to be shifted by 5 mm for the segments to look aligned – that is a 10% relative offset illusion. We define:

$$\text{Illusion Strength} = \frac{\text{Apparent offset at PSE}}{\text{Gap between parallels}} \times \frac{1}{0.20}$$

Where 0.20 represents a typical maximum effect (20% of gap width). This can be simplified to:

$$\text{Illusion Strength} = \frac{x}{d \times 0.20}$$

Where x is the required offset and d is the distance between parallel lines.

By normalizing to the gap, the measure is dimensionless. If no offset is needed (perceived alignment is veridical), strength = 0. Larger required shifts indicate stronger illusion. The Poggendorff illusion strength typically depends on the angle of the transverse line: steep angles yield a smaller effect, while a ~45° diagonal maximizes misalignment perception ([Poggendorff illusion | psychology | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/Poggendorff-illusion#:~:text=The%20Poggendorff%20illusion%20depends%20on,Ponzo%20illusion%2C%20seems%20larger%20than%E2%80%A6)). We can set the 100% level (1.0) as the offset observed at the most "compelling" configuration (often around 30–45°). In practice, reported misalignment errors are on the order of a few degrees or a few percent of the gap ([Poggendorff illusion | psychology | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/Poggendorff-illusion#:~:text=The%20Poggendorff%20illusion%20depends%20on,Ponzo%20illusion%2C%20seems%20larger%20than%E2%80%A6)), so many configurations might yield strengths ~0.2–0.5. 

**Heuristic Algorithm:** 
1. Represent the geometry: angle of the transverse line θ, distance \(d\) between parallels. 
2. Find the horizontal offset \(x\) one must apply to the second segment so that observers perceive one continuous straight line. 
3. Compute \(x/d\) as the raw illusion index. 
4. Normalize by the maximum \(x/d\) found over a range of θ (if 0.2 is the largest typical fraction, divide by 0.2). 

This gives a 0–1 scaled strength. Validate by comparing predictions to human settings or error rates in alignment tasks. (For instance, a strength of 1 should correspond to the angle that yields the largest misalignment error in experiments, and strength should drop as the diagonal becomes either more vertical or horizontal, consistent with known reductions in the illusion ([Poggendorff illusion | psychology | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/Poggendorff-illusion#:~:text=The%20Poggendorff%20illusion%20depends%20on,Ponzo%20illusion%2C%20seems%20larger%20than%E2%80%A6)).)

### Vertical–Horizontal Illusion (Vertical Line vs. Horizontal Line)  
**Description:** A vertical line often appears longer than an equal horizontal line. In the vertical–horizontal illusion, a **vertical extent is overestimated** relative to an identical horizontal extent ([
            A Thickness Illusion: Horizontal Is Perceived as Thicker than Vertical - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6802759/#:~:text=illusion%20which%20has%20been%20studied,length%20of%20a%20horizontal%20line)). This illusion is commonly observed in a simple “T” or cross shape: the vertical arm of a cross looks longer than the horizontal arm of the same length.

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** The strength can be captured by the percentage length difference at the PSE. Observers might adjust the length of a horizontal line until it appears equal to a given vertical line. If the horizontal must be, say, 5% longer for a match, then the illusion magnitude is ~5%. We define: 

$$\text{Illusion Strength} = \frac{|L_{\text{vertical, perceived equal}} - L_{\text{horizontal}}|}{L_{\text{horizontal}}} \times \frac{1}{0.10}$$

Where 0.10 represents the maximum typical effect (10% length difference). This can be simplified as:

$$\text{Illusion Strength} = \frac{|\Delta L|}{L \times 0.10}$$

Using the example, if a 100 px horizontal line must be 105 px to look equal to a 100 px vertical, strength = 0.05/0.10 = 0.5. In studies, typical overestimation of vertical length is on the order of a few percent. For instance, one experiment found about a **3.9%** effect under certain conditions ([
            A Thickness Illusion: Horizontal Is Perceived as Thicker than Vertical - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6802759/#:~:text=show%20a%20comparable%20order%20of,3%20in%20the)), though it can increase with added context like frames or junctions ([
            A Thickness Illusion: Horizontal Is Perceived as Thicker than Vertical - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6802759/#:~:text=condition%2C%20where%20the%20illusion%20was,The%20bandwidths%20for%20the)). We can normalize 100% illusion as perhaps ~10% difference (a larger effect seen with strong contextual cues ([
            A Thickness Illusion: Horizontal Is Perceived as Thicker than Vertical - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6802759/#:~:text=condition%2C%20where%20the%20illusion%20was,The%20bandwidths%20for%20the))). Thus, a 5% measured distortion becomes 0.5 on the normalized scale.

**Proposed Algorithm:** 
- Given a vertical length \(V\) and horizontal \(H\) (initially equal), find the required horizontal length \(H'\) such that the line appears as long as \(V\). 
- Compute \( \Delta = |H' - V|/V \). For most observers \(H' > V\), yielding a positive \(\Delta\) (verticals appear \(\Delta\) longer). 
- Normalize by an upper-bound (e.g. 0.10). 

So if \(V=H=50\) mm, and the observer adjusts \(H'\) to 55 mm, \(\Delta = 0.10\), giving a strength of 1.0 (assuming 10% is our reference max). If a scenario yields \(\Delta = 0.04\), that’s strength 0.4. This metric captures the perceptual bias (vertical vs horizontal) rather than just absolute error. Validation can include manipulating context (like adding frames or other elements) and confirming the metric increases when the illusion is known to get stronger ([
            A Thickness Illusion: Horizontal Is Perceived as Thicker than Vertical - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6802759/#:~:text=condition%2C%20where%20the%20illusion%20was,The%20bandwidths%20for%20the)), and that it diminishes (toward 0) when cues that cause the anisotropy (e.g. perspective or framing) are removed ([
            A Thickness Illusion: Horizontal Is Perceived as Thicker than Vertical - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6802759/#:~:text=show%20a%20comparable%20order%20of,3%20in%20the)).

### Zöllner Illusion (Misjudged Parallelism)  
**Description:** In the Zöllner illusion, long lines that are truly parallel appear to diverge or converge because they are crossed by short ticks at an angle ([Zollner illusion](https://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/akitaoka/zollnere.html#:~:text=Zollner%20illusion%20It%20is%20said,90%20deg%20gives%20this)). The **orientation** of the background ticks skews the perceived angle of the long lines, making parallel lines seem non-parallel. 

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** We measure how much we must rotate the lines to null the illusion. Observers can adjust the angle between the long lines until they *appear* parallel ([Zollner illusion](https://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/akitaoka/zollnere.html#:~:text=Zollner%20illusion%20It%20is%20said,90%20deg%20gives%20this)). The difference between true parallel (0°) and the adjusted angle is the illusion magnitude in degrees. For instance, if the lines must actually be tilted 2° relative to each other (one clockwise, one counterclockwise) to appear parallel under the influence of the ticks, the illusion induces a 2° orientation error. We can normalize this by a reference maximum (the maximal bias occurs at certain tick intersection angles, often around 10°–30° tick slant relative to the main lines ([Zollner illusion](https://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/akitaoka/zollnere.html#:~:text=Zollner%20illusion%20It%20is%20said,90%20deg%20gives%20this))). If 2° is near the max seen, that might correspond to strength ~1.0. If only 0.5° adjustment is needed, strength would be 0.25.

In relative terms, one can also express the effect as a percentage of the crossing angle of the short ticks. For example, if the ticks are at 45° and they cause a 2° slant illusion, that is about 4.4% of the tick angle. However, a direct degree measure is more intuitive here.

**Heuristic Algorithm:** 
1. For two supposedly parallel lines, let the observer rotate one line until they appear parallel (under the influence of the patterned background). Record the small angle \( \alpha \) between the lines at the subjective parallel point. 
2. Define raw illusion magnitude = \( |\alpha| \) (in degrees). 
3. Normalize by an angle that corresponds to a strong illusion. Empirically, the Zöllner illusion is maximal at certain crossing angles (e.g. ~15° ticks might produce a ~0.5° illusion; ~45° ticks might produce larger ~2–3° illusions) ([Zollner illusion](https://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/akitaoka/zollnere.html#:~:text=Zollner%20illusion%20It%20is%20said,90%20deg%20gives%20this)). Suppose 3° is the largest observed in a given setup, use that as the divisor. 

Thus, strength = \(\alpha/3°\). If ticks at 45° cause \(\alpha=2°\), that yields ~0.67. If ticks at 10° cause \(\alpha=0.5°\), that might be ~0.17, reflecting that the 10° case is weaker (indeed Zöllner effect tends to weaken at very shallow or very steep crossing angles ([Zollner illusion](https://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/akitaoka/zollnere.html#:~:text=Zollner%20illusion%20It%20is%20said,90%20deg%20gives%20this))). This metric directly ties to perceived angular distortion. We would validate by confirming known trends: e.g. the metric should peak at intermediate crossing angles and drop when the tick angle is too steep or shallow, matching published data on Zöllner illusion magnitude ([Zollner illusion](https://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/akitaoka/zollnere.html#:~:text=Zollner%20illusion%20It%20is%20said,90%20deg%20gives%20this)).

### Red–Yellow Boundary Illusion (Color Boundary and Categorical Perception)  
**Description:** This refers to distortions in perception that occur at boundaries between different colors – for example, at the border of a red and a yellow region. Human vision exhibits **categorical perception** of color: differences that cross a color category boundary (like red vs yellow) can be perceptually exaggerated. Additionally, if the red and yellow are isoluminant (equal brightness), the boundary may appear unstable or distorted because the usual luminance edge cues are absent ([The influence of Müller-Lyer illusion on length assessment: The alternative way of measuring the strength of the illusion](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387413454_The_influence_of_Muller-Lyer_illusion_on_length_assessment_The_alternative_way_of_measuring_the_strength_of_the_illusion#:~:text=experiments%2C%20the%20method%20of%20two,pass%20chromatic%20filters)). In some cases, a slight shimmer or spatial distortion at the red–yellow border is reported due to chromatic aberration or lateral inhibition differences in color channels.

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** One way to quantify a color-boundary illusion is to measure how much the perceived color difference or boundary position deviates from expectation. For instance, observers can mark the exact location of a color boundary in a gradient. If the boundary is mislocalized or appears shifted (due to neural processing emphasizing category differences), that shift in units of visual angle can be measured. Another approach is to use a color difference metric: e.g., present two color patches that are objectively identical on either side of the category boundary and ask if they look different; the strength could be the **just-noticeable difference (JND)** in color space that the illusion induces beyond physical differences.

A simpler normalized measure is the *amplification of perceived difference*: if two colors straddle the red/yellow boundary, observers might require a smaller wavelength difference to tell them apart than if the colors are within one category. Suppose normally a 5 nm wavelength change is one JND, but at the category boundary a 3 nm change is noticeable; the illusion (categorical sharpening) could be said to amplify difference by 5/3 ~1.67×. We could then define illusion strength = (Baseline JND / Boundary JND) – 1, normalized appropriately. Alternatively, for spatial distortions at isoluminant edges, one could measure apparent blur or offset: e.g. how much added luminance contrast is needed to stabilize the boundary. Research shows that at isoluminance, certain geometric illusions (like Müller–Lyer) become up to **1.5–2× stronger** ([The influence of Müller-Lyer illusion on length assessment: The alternative way of measuring the strength of the illusion](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387413454_The_influence_of_Muller-Lyer_illusion_on_length_assessment_The_alternative_way_of_measuring_the_strength_of_the_illusion#:~:text=experiments%2C%20the%20method%20of%20two,pass%20chromatic%20filters)), indicating that removing luminance cues (using purely chromatic red-vs-yellow contrast) increases distortion. We could take that ratio as a strength metric in itself.

**Heuristic Algorithm:** 
- *Categorical color difference:* Measure discrimination threshold (JND) for two shades of color on the same side of the red/yellow boundary versus across the boundary. Compute the ratio or difference. A larger perceptual jump at the boundary yields a higher score. Normalize such that a very pronounced category effect (e.g. 2× difference in thresholds) maps to 1.0. 
- *Chromatic edge distortion:* Take a known geometric illusion (like those above) and compare its strength in a luminance-defined version vs an isoluminant red/yellow version ([The influence of Müller-Lyer illusion on length assessment: The alternative way of measuring the strength of the illusion](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387413454_The_influence_of_Muller-Lyer_illusion_on_length_assessment_The_alternative_way_of_measuring_the_strength_of_the_illusion#:~:text=experiments%2C%20the%20method%20of%20two,pass%20chromatic%20filters)). The increase in illusion magnitude (percentage-wise) due to isoluminance is the color-boundary illusion strength. For example, if Müller–Lyer distortion goes from 10% to 20% at isoluminant red/yellow, that 100% increase can be normalized as 1.0 (maximal enhancement by color boundary). 

In summary, the Red–Yellow boundary illusion strength might not be a single number for all contexts, but these heuristics capture the *perceptual distortion from color processing*. Validation can include verifying that the metric is high at known category boundaries (e.g. red/yellow, blue/green) and near zero within a uniform color range. Neurophysiological evidence shows category boundaries do affect early perception ([Neurophysiological evidence for categorical perception of color | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23461174_Neurophysiological_evidence_for_categorical_perception_of_color#:~:text=elicited%20on%20a%20passive%20visual,later%20stages%20of%20chromatic%20processing)) ([Neurophysiological evidence for categorical perception of color | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23461174_Neurophysiological_evidence_for_categorical_perception_of_color#:~:text=,13)), supporting the idea that this metric correlates with boundary-enhanced perception.

### “Clock Angle” Illusion (Misestimation of Angles)  
**Description:** The “clock angle” illusion refers to misperception of angles – for example, two equal angles might appear different depending on their orientation or context, akin to looking at clock hands. Humans are not uniformly accurate at judging all angles; shallow angles can be overestimated in some contexts, and right angles can appear acute or obtuse when embedded in certain shapes ([Global shape versus local feature: an angle illusion - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18430451/#:~:text=an%20angle%20,In%20sum%2C%20our)) ([Global shape versus local feature: an angle illusion - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18430451/#:~:text=an%20angle%20,In%20sum%2C%20our)). One known demonstration: an angle within an *isosceles triangle* is perceived larger than the same angle in a *scalene triangle* ([Global shape versus local feature: an angle illusion - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18430451/#:~:text=an%20angle%20,In%20sum%2C%20our)). By analogy, if one imagines clock hands forming identical angles at different rotations, those might appear unequal (“clock” reference suggests using the clock face positions to specify angle orientation).

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** We measure the difference between perceived angle and actual angle. For a given actual angle (say 60° between two lines), an observer might consistently judge it as, for example, 74° when it’s part of an isosceles configuration vs 60° in a scalene configuration ([Global shape versus local feature: an angle illusion - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18430451/#:~:text=an%20angle%20,In%20sum%2C%20our)) ([Global shape versus local feature: an angle illusion - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18430451/#:~:text=triangles%20with%20those%20of%20angles,than%20the%20same%20angle%20embedded)). The illusion magnitude here is 14° of perceptual error. To normalize, we could use the actual angle as a reference: e.g., 14° error on a 60° angle is 23.3%. Alternatively, treat the maximum observed bias for any angle as 1.0. Kennedy et al. (2008) found errors ~14° for angles ~60° in certain contexts ([Global shape versus local feature: an angle illusion - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18430451/#:~:text=an%20angle%20,In%20sum%2C%20our)) ([Global shape versus local feature: an angle illusion - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18430451/#:~:text=triangles%20with%20those%20of%20angles,than%20the%20same%20angle%20embedded)) – that could represent a high end (perhaps ~0.23 in relative terms, which we map to 1.0 in normalized units for a given context).

**Heuristic Algorithm:** 
- Present an angle (formed by two line segments, like clock hands) in a specific context (e.g., part of a shape or at a certain orientation). Have the observer report or adjust it to what they believe is a target angle. Alternatively, present two angles (one reference, one test) and ask if they are equal. 
- Determine the point of subjective equality: e.g., at what physical angle does the test angle appear 60° to the observer. The difference from 60° is the illusion in that context. 
- Illusion Strength can be computed as \( |\text{PerceivedAngle} - \text{TrueAngle}| / \text{TrueAngle} \). For the above example, \( |74 - 60|/60 ≈ 0.233 \). 
- Normalize by dividing by the maximum fraction observed across a range of angles or contexts. If the largest relative error seen is say 0.25 (25%), use that as 1.0. In our example, strength ≈ 0.93 on that scale. 

We might simplify normalization by focusing on absolute angle error in degrees and defining a cap (e.g. 15° error = 1.0 for moderate angles). The measure is firmly rooted in perception: it reflects how much an angle’s appearance deviates from reality. Validation would involve checking various known angle illusions: the metric should be higher for angles in isosceles triangles than scalene (as found empirically ([Global shape versus local feature: an angle illusion - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18430451/#:~:text=triangles%20with%20those%20of%20angles,than%20the%20same%20angle%20embedded))), and it should possibly show that oblique angles on a clock face (like 2:00 vs 4:00 positions for equal angles) yield nonzero strength if observers systematically misjudge one orientation compared to another (due to the brain’s bias for vertical/horizontal references – a form of the “oblique effect”).

### Café Wall Illusion (Tilted Grid Illusion)  
**Description:** The Café Wall illusion is a pattern of black and white tiles arranged in offset rows with thin dividing lines. The horizontal grout lines between offset checker rows appear sloped or wedge-shaped, even though they are physically straight and parallel ([Poggendorff illusion | psychology | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/Poggendorff-illusion#:~:text=The%20Poggendorff%20illusion%20depends%20on,Ponzo%20illusion%2C%20seems%20larger%20than%E2%80%A6)). It’s an illusion of **geometric distortion** where parallel lines seem tilted.

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** We measure the apparent tilt angle of what should be horizontal lines. If the grey mortar lines between rows appear to tilt by, say, 5° relative to the true horizontal, the illusion magnitude is 5°. A normalized measure can be the tilt relative to the maximum possible or an estimated maximum illusion. For example, if by extreme configuration an illusion could perhaps induce a ~10° apparent tilt, then a 5° observed tilt = 0.5 strength. Another metric is the **slope difference** between alternate segments of the line: one can fit a sawtooth wave to the perceived grout line and measure its amplitude in degrees.

The illusion is stronger with higher contrast edges and certain spacer widths, and diminishes if the mortar lines are removed or made very thick. So one can also normalize against a reference configuration (e.g. black/white tiles with a thin mid-grey line yields strongest effect ~1.0). 

**Heuristic Algorithm:** 
- Construct the pattern and ask observers to adjust the tilt of an overlaid line to match the apparent slant of the grout line. Alternatively, measure the perceived angle by having observers mark the orientation. Suppose the true horizontal is 0° and they judge the grout line to align with a 5° guide – that’s a 5° illusion. 
- Illusion Strength = (Apparent tilt in degrees) / (Max reference tilt). Using 10° as reference, 5° becomes 0.5. 
- Another approach: Compute the Fourier components or edge orientation in the image after perceptual filtering (e.g., convolve with a human visual blur kernel). The strongest illusion occurs when the visual system’s oriented edge detectors are most imbalanced, causing a tilt signal. One could define strength ∝ (orientation signal energy at the illusory tilt) / (orientation energy at true horizontal). 

For simplicity, the geometric measure is clearer. Validating the metric involves checking that it increases with known factors: e.g., more offset between tiles increases tilt illusion up to a point, and high contrast yields a larger tilt. If our algorithm yields near 1.0 for the classic high-contrast checker with a thin line ([Poggendorff illusion | psychology | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/Poggendorff-illusion#:~:text=The%20Poggendorff%20illusion%20depends%20on,Ponzo%20illusion%2C%20seems%20larger%20than%E2%80%A6)) and near 0 for a uniform checkerboard (no offset, no illusion), it is capturing the perceptual distortion appropriately.

### Checker Shadow Illusion (Brightness/Lightness Constancy)  
**Description:** In Adelson’s checker-shadow illusion, two squares A and B on a checkerboard have identical pixel intensities, but one is in a shadow and the other is in bright light. The square in shadow (B) is perceived as much lighter than it really is – appearing the same as a truly lighter square A outside the shadow ([Adelson's Checker-Shadow Illusion - The Illusions Index](https://www.illusionsindex.org/i/adelson-s-checker-shadow-illusion#:~:text=The%20tile%20labelled%20,the%20same%20shade%20of%20grey)). This illusion demonstrates **lightness constancy**: the visual system discounts the shadow, causing a large perceptual distortion in brightness ([Adelson's Checker-Shadow Illusion - The Illusions Index](https://www.illusionsindex.org/i/adelson-s-checker-shadow-illusion#:~:text=Adelson%E2%80%99s%20Checkershadow%20Illusion)) ([Adelson's Checker-Shadow Illusion - The Illusions Index](https://www.illusionsindex.org/i/adelson-s-checker-shadow-illusion#:~:text=%E2%80%98thought,We%20outline%20both%20below)).

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** We can quantify how different the physical intensities can be while still appearing equal. In the classic image, the reflectance (pixel value) of tile B is significantly higher than tile A (B is a light gray, A a dark gray), yet they look the same ([Adelson's Checker-Shadow Illusion - The Illusions Index](https://www.illusionsindex.org/i/adelson-s-checker-shadow-illusion#:~:text=The%20tile%20labelled%20,the%20same%20shade%20of%20grey)). For instance, suppose tile A has an intensity of 50 (dark) and tile B 150 (lighter on an 0–255 scale), but our brain sees them as equal gray. The illusion “strength” could be measured as the ratio of those intensities normalized to what the eye perceives. A straightforward metric: 

- **Illusion Strength = |L<sub>A</sub> – L<sub>B</sub>| / L<sub range}**, in a scenario where perceptually A = B. 

Using the above numbers, |50–150|/255 ≈ 0.39. This indicates the visual system tolerated a 39% difference in luminance due to context. We might normalize by a typical maximum: Adelson’s demo is extreme; a ~100 unit difference appearing equal might be near maximal under real-world conditions, so we could set that as ~1.0. Another interpretation: how much the perceived lightness deviates from the actual luminance. If tile B is physically 150 but appears like 50, the perceptual error is 100 units (two-thirds of B’s actual value). As a fraction of B’s actual value, that’s 100/150 ≈ 0.667. We could use that too, indicating a 66.7% distortion toward constancy. We would then normalize such that a 100% misperception (completely ignoring physical difference) is 1.0.

**Heuristic Algorithm:** 
- Identify two patches in the scene that observers say look identical in shade. Measure their actual luminance (or RGB values). 
- Compute the difference or ratio between these values. For example, difference = 100 units, ratio = 3:1 in our example (B is 3× brighter than A physically). 
- Translate this into a 0–1 score. If we choose the ratio form, we might say illusion strength = 1 – (A/B) in the case A < B. Here 1 – (50/150) = 0.667. If no illusion (A and B physically identical), A/B =1, strength = 0. 
- Normalize relative to a maximum expected ratio. Adelson’s checker is often cited as nearly the extreme; many real shadow illusions might cause, say, a doubling of intensity to be misperceived, which would be 1 – (1/2) = 0.5. So the classic illusion might score close to 1.0 by that yardstick. 

This metric directly ties to perceived constancy error. It captures that *despite* a large physical difference, perception remains “fooled” into equality. Validation can be done by comparing with human lightness matching experiments: our score should correlate with known data on how much lighter a shadowed patch has to be to appear equal to a reference in light ([Adelson's Checker-Shadow Illusion - The Illusions Index](https://www.illusionsindex.org/i/adelson-s-checker-shadow-illusion#:~:text=%E2%80%98thought,We%20outline%20both%20below)). Indeed, if observers set two patches to equalize brightness across shadow, the physical differences recorded should feed into our formula and yield consistent strength values. The **checker-shadow** illusion often yields one of the highest strength scores (demonstrating nearly complete perceptual compensation for illumination). Our normalized 0–1 scale would reflect that (Adelson’s figure ~0.8–1.0, whereas a weaker lightness illusion might score lower).

### Fraser Spiral Illusion (False Spiral Perception)  
**Description:** The Fraser spiral illusion (also known as the twisted cord illusion) is a pattern of concentric circles made up of segments with alternating orientations and colors. The segments trick the brain into seeing a continuous spiral, even though geometrically it’s a set of circles. The illusion is one of **shape distortion** – perceiving a spiral where there is none.

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** We measure how “open” the perceived spiral is compared to the reality of closed circles. One way is to measure the perceived pitch of the spiral: e.g., how far does one have to go around the circle (in degrees) to mistakenly drop to the next circle. If observers trace along what they think is a spiral, they will drift from one circle to another. The **offset per revolution** could quantify the illusion. For instance, if after going 360° around, the traced path is one ring (say 10 mm) inward from where it started (due to following the illusory spiral), that offset relative to circle spacing is the illusion magnitude.

Another measure: The tilt of the small line elements relative to radial direction generates the spiral impression. If the segments are at 5° to the true circle tangent, the brain might integrate that as a 5° per segment “twist.” Over many segments, it sums to a large apparent rotation. We could sum the tiny orientation deviations across one full circle to estimate how far off alignment the mind gets. If the cumulative effect equals, say, 360° + 30° (meaning you think you’ve gone 30° further around than actual by the time you reach alignment again), that 30° overshoot is a measure of illusion.

In simpler terms, define **illusion strength** as the fraction of observers who report a spiral vs a circle (a binary outcome), or how confident they are. But a quantitative approach: 

- **Illusion Strength = (Perceived angle of spiral per actual 360°) – 360°, normalized.** 

If the pattern makes one full circle look like a spiral turn of 370° (overshoot of 10°), strength might be 10/360 = 0.028 in raw terms. Because that number is small (the illusion is strong qualitatively but in terms of angle per small segment it’s subtle), another normalization could set a score of 1 for the full impression of a spiral. We could arbitrarily say if the pattern were such that it effectively appears to have advanced one extra full circle (impossible with typical Fraser figures), that would be 1.0. More practically, we might calibrate strength by subjective rating or error rate following the spiral path.

**Heuristic Algorithm:** 
- Represent the Fraser figure as concentric circles with a given segment tilt (the angle each segment is rotated relative to perfect alignment). Typical illusions might use ~45° tilted segments, which give a very strong spiral impression. 
- Compute the effective spiral pitch: e.g., simulate a path that follows the local orientation of segments. See how far radially it moves per revolution. 
- Calculate the ratio of radial movement to what it would be if it were a true spiral. If the path moves inward by, say, one circle spacing after going around once, relative to no movement for a true circle, define that as the raw illusion magnitude (one circle of error per circle traveled = 100% error in shape). In practice, Fraser spiral might cause something like nearly one circle of drift over several revolutions. 
- Normalize on a scale 0–1 by setting a reference (perhaps the standard Fraser figure yields ~0.8). 

This algorithm is more geometric. Another approach: have observers mark whether certain arcs belong to the same circle or not. The rate of mistakes can quantify illusion strength (100% mistakes = strong illusion, 0% = none). That percentage could directly serve as a 0–1 measure. 

Validation for the Fraser illusion metric can involve variant patterns: if we reduce the segment tilt to 0 (just concentric circles), our measure should drop to 0 (no illusion). If we randomize segment orientations, again no coherent spiral is seen (strength 0). At optimal tilt (somewhere intermediate angles, often ~45°), the measure should peak, reflecting maximal spiral impression. This aligns with how the illusion is understood: a **configural effect** where local orientations mislead global interpretation ([Poggendorff illusion | psychology | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/Poggendorff-illusion#:~:text=The%20Poggendorff%20illusion%20depends%20on,Ponzo%20illusion%2C%20seems%20larger%20than%E2%80%A6)).

### Kanizsa Triangle (Illusory Contours)  
**Description:** The Kanizsa triangle illusion uses three “Pac-Man” shapes arranged such that their cut-out sections imply the presence of a bright triangle that isn’t actually drawn. The brain perceives **illusory contours** of a triangle and even a brighter surface inside it. The strength is essentially how salient or real those illusory edges appear.

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** A standard way to quantify an illusory contour’s strength is to match it to a real, faint contour. Researchers have asked observers to adjust the contrast of a real line until it *just matches* the perceived Kanizsa contour ([
            The perceived strength of illusory contours | Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03211704#:~:text=substance%20complicates%20their%20specification%20via,It%20appears%20that)) ([
            The perceived strength of illusory contours | Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03211704#:~:text=are%20easily%20quantified%20physically,quantitative%20studies%20of%20illusory%20contours)). The resulting contrast (or luminance difference) of the matched real line can be taken as an equivalent strength of the illusion. For example, if the illusory edge looks as strong as a real line of 5% contrast, that’s the illusion’s effective contrast. We can normalize this by the contrast of the inducing shapes. If the inducers are black on white (100% contrast) and the illusory edge is equivalent to 5%, then the normalized strength = 0.05. 

Another aspect is the area brightness: the illusory triangle often looks slightly brighter than the background. One could measure the apparent brightness difference and express it relative to the background (also yielding a percentage). But the contour clarity is the primary measure.

Notably, illusory contour clarity varies with inducer size, gap, and sharpness. Longer inducers and smaller gaps yield stronger illusions ([
            The perceived strength of illusory contours | Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03211704#:~:text=substance%20complicates%20their%20specification%20via,It%20appears%20that)). For normalization, 1.0 could correspond to an illusory contour as vivid as a real one (which typically does not happen – Kanizsa contours are usually much fainter than real edges). In practice, strengths might be in the 0.1–0.3 range (10–30% of a comparable real edge’s contrast) depending on conditions.

**Heuristic Algorithm:** 
- Present a Kanizsa figure. Side-by-side, present a real triangle with adjustable edge contrast. Have the observer tune the real edges until they are just as visible as the illusory ones. 
- Take the final contrast value \(C\) (e.g. Michelson contrast) of the real lines. If the background is uniform, $C$ of the illusory contour is effectively 0 (since physically there’s no edge), but perceptually it equals that of the set lines. If \(C = 0.10\) (10%), record that. 
- Normalize by the maximum possible contrast of an inducer. If the inducers are black on white (100%), one could use 1.0 as the theoretical max (if the illusion were as strong as a real black line, which it isn’t). More practically, one could normalize by the highest matched contrast found in any experiment (say 15% for a very optimal Kanizsa square ([
            The perceived strength of illusory contours | Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03211704#:~:text=substance%20complicates%20their%20specification%20via,It%20appears%20that))). So if our triangle was 10%, strength = 0.67 relative to that max. 
- Alternatively, define strength = \(C\) directly as a fraction (since \(C \le 1\) by definition). Then our example 0.10 is the strength on 0–1 scale relative to a full contrast edge. 

This metric focuses on the perceptual *equivalence* of illusory and real contours ([
            The perceived strength of illusory contours | Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03211704#:~:text=substance%20complicates%20their%20specification%20via,It%20appears%20that)). We validate it by known manipulations: reducing inducer contrast should lower illusory contour strength (and indeed observers match it to an even fainter line) ([
            The perceived strength of illusory contours | Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03211704#:~:text=substance%20complicates%20their%20specification%20via,It%20appears%20that)). Increasing inducer size or using four inducers (illusory square) often strengthens the effect; our measure should reflect that (higher equivalent contrast). Such measurements have been used and show, for example, that *illusory contours can behave like real weak edges* in terms of activating visual cortex ([
            The perceived strength of illusory contours
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03211704#:~:text=The%20perceived%20strength%20of%20illusory,defined%20contours)).

### Rotating Snakes Illusion (Peripheral Drift Motion)  
**Description:** The Rotating Snakes illusion is a static image that induces a strong impression of motion – colorful “snakes” or concentric annular patterns appear to rotate continuously ([“Rotating Snakes” with luminance control](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-snakesLum/#:~:text=When%20looking%20around%20the%20above,which%20are%20now%20small%20wedges)) ([“Rotating Snakes” with luminance control](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-snakesLum/#:~:text=recording,fro%20motion)). The illusion arises from specific luminance and color contrasts in a repeating pattern, which trigger motion detectors in the visual system ([“Rotating Snakes” with luminance control](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-snakesLum/#:~:text=recording,fro%20motion)). The strength can be thought of as how fast or how frequently motion is perceived, given that there is in fact none.

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** One way to quantify the illusion’s strength is to determine an **equivalent real motion speed**. For instance, we can present a comparison: a real rotating wheel at a very slow speed next to the illusory “snake” disk, and adjust the real rotation until observers say it matches the perceived speed of the illusion. If they match it to (say) 2° per second rotation, that is the illusory angular velocity. We could then express that as a fraction of some reference speed (perhaps 2°/s itself could be considered strength 1.0 in a standard viewing condition). If under different conditions the illusion appears slower or not at all, the strength would be lower (down to 0 when no motion is seen).

Another measure is the **proportion of time (or proportion of observers)** that see motion. For example, some people might see the snakes rotate almost constantly (strong illusion), whereas others see intermittent or no motion. In a given viewing, one might quantify what fraction of a 60-second period the motion is perceived. A very strong instance might yield “motion” 80% of the time (strength 0.8), whereas a weaker pattern yields 20% (0.2). This captures both the subjective and intermittent nature of the effect.

Finally, a more mechanistic metric comes from models: one can compute the net motion signal in a computational model of low-level vision ([“Rotating Snakes” with luminance control](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-snakesLum/#:~:text=recording,fro%20motion)). The **residual motion detector response** (after canceling real motion) can serve as a strength indicator. Bach and colleagues (2017) did a quantitative analysis varying the luminance steps and found certain “islands” of luminance combinations that maximize or even reverse the illusory rotation ([“Rotating Snakes” with luminance control](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-snakesLum/#:~:text=With%20calibrated%20luminance%2C%20you%20can,setting)) ([“Rotating Snakes” with luminance control](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-snakesLum/#:~:text=recording,fro%20motion)). The magnitude of that motion response or the degree of eye-movement needed to trigger it can be normalized.

**Heuristic Algorithm (observer-based):** 
- Display the Rotating Snakes pattern. Also display a physical rotating marker whose speed can be adjusted. Ask the viewer to tune the marker’s rotation to match the illusory motion. Record the angular velocity \(v\) (degrees/second or rotations per minute). 
- Define illusion strength = \(v / v_{\text{ref}}\). You might set \(v_{\text{ref}} = 2°/s\) as a baseline (if that’s a typical match). In an experiment, if most people match ~2°/s for the standard image, that becomes 1.0. If a variant image yields only ~1°/s perceived (half as fast), that scores 0.5. If flicker or other conditions amplify it to 3°/s, that could go above 1 (but we usually cap at 1 for the normalized scale, treating the standard configuration as max = 1). 
- Optionally, incorporate duration: if motion is not steady, you could weight the speed by the duty cycle of perception. E.g., if they said “it spins for about half the time I look,” then effective strength = 0.5 * (match speed / ref speed). 

**Heuristic Algorithm (signal-based):**  
- Use an optical flow algorithm or a motion-energy model on the image with a simulated saccade input ([“Rotating Snakes” with luminance control](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-snakesLum/#:~:text=recording,fro%20motion)). Compute the average motion energy it produces. Normalize this to the energy produced by a small real motion. The ratio can be the strength. 

By either method, validation is possible by known manipulations: reducing the asymmetry in the luminance sequence (making the pattern symmetric) abolishes the illusion ([“Rotating Snakes” with luminance control](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-snakesLum/#:~:text=Illusion%20versus%20non)), and our metric should then go to 0 (no equivalent speed, no motion signal) ([“Rotating Snakes” with luminance control](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-snakesLum/#:~:text=When%20the%20asymmetric%20sequence%20is,the%20symmetric%20one%204%20steps)). Conversely, the original high-contrast asymmetric pattern yields a robust motion (our chosen 1.0). Changing luminance step order can even reverse perceived rotation direction ([“Rotating Snakes” with luminance control](https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-snakesLum/#:~:text=As%20detailed%20on%20the%20previous,to%20the%20neighbouring%20light%20grey)), which our metric would capture as a sign change in the motion measure (though for “strength” we focus on magnitude). Eye-tracking studies also show the illusion is strongest when observers make microsaccades; a validation could be that our metric correlates with the frequency of those eye movements allowed. The key is that the metric reflects *perceptual motion intensity*, not any physical difference (since physically nothing moves). 

### Ebbinghaus Illusion (Size-Contrast Circles)  
**Description:** In the Ebbinghaus illusion, a circle surrounded by large circles appears smaller than an identical circle surrounded by small circles. It’s an illusion of **perceived size** caused by context ([Frontiers | Quantifying the Ebbinghaus figure effect: target size, context size, and target-context distance determine the presence and direction of the illusion](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01679/full#:~:text=manifestation%20of%2045%20illusions%20%28e,also%20called%20Titchener%20circles)) ([Frontiers | Quantifying the Ebbinghaus figure effect: target size, context size, and target-context distance determine the presence and direction of the illusion](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01679/full#:~:text=FIGURE%201)). The central circles are equal, but one looks ~“shrunk” and the other ~“expanded” by comparison.

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** The standard measure is how much one must change the target circle’s diameter to compensate for the context. Observers adjust one of the center circles until both centers appear the same size ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8164370/#:~:text=The%20seven%20illusions%20tested%20in,and%20binocularly)) ([

The difference in diameter at the PSE, expressed as a fraction of the original, is the illusion strength. For example, if the right central disk among large inducers must be 10% bigger to look equal to the left disk among small inducers, that’s a 10% illusion ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8164370/#:~:text=The%20seven%20illusions%20tested%20in,and%20binocularly)). We define:

- **Illusion Strength = (PSE diameter difference / true diameter).**

Often the Ebbinghaus illusion yields a modest effect: studies report typically on the order of a few to ten percent difference ([Frontiers | Quantifying the Ebbinghaus figure effect: target size, context size, and target-context distance determine the presence and direction of the illusion](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01679/full#:~:text=illusion%20magnitude%2C%20the%20perceptual%20distinctiveness%2C,psychophysical%20and%20motor%20control%20studies)). One paper found a range from 0% up to an exceptional ~10% of target size depending on configuration ([Frontiers | Quantifying the Ebbinghaus figure effect: target size, context size, and target-context distance determine the presence and direction of the illusion](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01679/full#:~:text=illusion%20magnitude%2C%20the%20perceptual%20distinctiveness%2C,psychophysical%20and%20motor%20control%20studies)). To normalize 0–1, we might take 10% as 1.0 in a standard setting (the “exceptional” high end in their data ([Frontiers | Quantifying the Ebbinghaus figure effect: target size, context size, and target-context distance determine the presence and direction of the illusion](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01679/full#:~:text=illusion%20magnitude%2C%20the%20perceptual%20distinctiveness%2C,psychophysical%20and%20motor%20control%20studies))). Thus, a measured 5% size difference becomes 0.5 strength. If no difference is needed (some individuals or conditions show little illusion ([Frontiers | Quantifying the Ebbinghaus figure effect: target size, context size, and target-context distance determine the presence and direction of the illusion](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01679/full#:~:text=illusion%20magnitude%2C%20the%20perceptual%20distinctiveness%2C,psychophysical%20and%20motor%20control%20studies))), that yields 0.

**Heuristic Algorithm:** 
- Let target diameter = \(D\). In one context (surrounded by big circles), have observer adjust \(D'\) in the other context (surrounded by small circles) until both targets seem equal. 
- Compute \( \Delta D = |D' - D|/D \). Assign a positive sign if the target in the “large context” had to be bigger (i.e., originally appeared smaller). Typically, one gets \(D' > D\) when the target was among large inducers, reflecting underestimation. 
- Normalize by 0.10 (or another chosen maximum). For instance, if \(D' = 1.06D\), then raw 0.06, strength = 0.6 (assuming 0.10 is max). 

This aligns with how susceptibility to Ebbinghaus is often quantified ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484025/#:~:text=The%20classic%20psychophysical%20method%20of,current%20study%2C%20to%20provide%20a)) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8164370/#:~:text=The%20seven%20illusions%20tested%20in,and%20binocularly)). Validation: Our metric should capture known parameter effects – if the inducer circles are very far from the target, the illusion weakens (our measured \(\Delta D\) goes toward 0). If they are very close, it strengthens up to some peak ([Frontiers | Quantifying the Ebbinghaus figure effect: target size, context size, and target-context distance determine the presence and direction of the illusion](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01679/full#:~:text=FIGURE%201)). Also, making all inducer circles equal to the target eliminates the illusion (our strength = 0). Cross-cultural or individual differences in illusion susceptibility ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484025/#:~:text=stimulus%20and%20its%20perceptual%20representation,24%20Jahoda%20%26%20Stacey)) ([

### Delboeuf Illusion (Surrounding Ring and Size)  
**Description:** The Delboeuf illusion is similar to Ebbinghaus but uses a ring (circle outline) around a solid circle. A dot will appear smaller when enclosed by a large ring and larger when enclosed by a ring only slightly bigger than it ([The Delboeuf Illusion. | Download Scientific Diagram - ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Delboeuf-Illusion_fig2_256449266#:~:text=The%20Delboeuf%20Illusion.%20,by%20a%20much%20larger%20circle)). This is effectively another **size contrast** illusion.

**Perceptual Strength Metric:** Like Ebbinghaus, we measure how much the inner circle’s size must be altered to appear equal under different ring sizes. For example, a dot inside a very large ring might need to be physically increased in diameter to match the apparent size of the same dot inside a snug ring. If a 20 mm dot with a large ring looks equal to a 22 mm dot with a small ring, that 10% difference is the illusion magnitude. So:

- **Illusion Strength = (Diameter difference at PSE) / (inner circle diameter).**

Normalized to 0–1, we again use a reasonable maximal effect. Delboeuf illusions in typical displays might also reach around 10–15% at most. (When used in portion size studies with plates, the illusion can make food portions look ~10% different in size, for instance.) So we could set 15% = 1.0. In the above example, 10% would be ~0.67.

**Heuristic Algorithm:** 
- Display two conditions: inner circle of size \(d\) with a large ring, and inner circle of adjustable size \(d'\) with a small ring (or no ring as baseline). Adjust \(d'\) until perceived sizes match. 
- Compute \( (d' - d)/d \). This gives the fraction change due to the ring context. 
- Normalize by dividing by 0.15 (if using 15% as a full-strength reference). 

If instead the illusion formulation is such that a circle with no ring vs with a ring is compared, one can similarly measure how the ring alters perceived size. For instance, “How large does a dot with a ring need to be to appear equal to a dot without a ring?” – the difference yields the illusion caused by that ring’s presence.

As a check, if the ring is exactly the same size as the dot (touching it), some studies find the dot can even appear slightly larger (an assimilation effect), meaning the sign of illusion might flip. Our metric can accommodate that with a positive/negative sign or just magnitude if we care only about strength. Typically, a ring moderately larger than the dot yields the strongest contrast illusion (dot looks smaller) ([The Delboeuf Illusion. | Download Scientific Diagram - ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Delboeuf-Illusion_fig2_256449266#:~:text=The%20Delboeuf%20Illusion.%20,by%20a%20much%20larger%20circle)). Our measure should peak there. Removing the ring (no context) yields no illusion (0). The measure should also correlate with subjective reports of portion size estimation in practical scenarios (thus validating that it captures perceived size distortion). 

## Normalizing Across Illusions and Validation

To compare illusion strength across these very different phenomena, we have defined each in a 0–1 normalized fashion. In general, **0** means no perceptual distortion (the illusion has been nullified or has no effect) and **1.0** corresponds to a strong effect under a standard reference condition (often the upper end of what’s observed experimentally for that illusion). These normalizations are based on perceptual impact, not arbitrary physical differences. For example, a 0.5 in Müller–Lyer (where lines appear 10% off in length) is not directly the same kind of physical difference as 0.5 in the Checker Shadow (where brightness might be off by 50%), but both indicate a medium-level illusion on their respective scales. 

To **validate** these metrics, one would: 

- **Within each illusion:** verify that the score correlates with known psychophysical data. For instance, if one design yields a higher PSE shift than another, it should get a higher strength value. Our metrics for length, size, and angle illusions directly use the PSE, so they inherently match experimental definitions ([
            The BTPI: An online battery for measuring susceptibility to visual illusions - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484025/#:~:text=The%20classic%20psychophysical%20method%20of,current%20study%2C%20to%20provide%20a)). For illusions like Kanizsa or Rotating Snakes, we would compare our computed strengths to subjective ratings or detection performance (e.g. a stronger illusory contour should be easier to detect, matching a higher equivalent contrast ([
            The perceived strength of illusory contours | Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
        ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03211704#:~:text=substance%20complicates%20their%20specification%20via,It%20appears%20that))).
- **Across illusions:** ensure that 0 means veridical perception in all cases (which it does by construction). A value of 1.0 is more arbitrary since different illusions have different “maxima.” However, if we anchor 1.0 to typical maximal contexts, we can at least say an illusion scoring 1.0 (e.g. Checker Shadow) is extremely powerful (large perceptual error), whereas 0.2 might be a subtle effect (like a slight angle misestimation). It’s important to interpret the scale within context. We could also validate cross-illusion by seeing if individuals who score high on one illusion (e.g. very susceptible, requiring large adjustments) also tend to score high on others – though research shows illusion susceptibilities are often uncorrelated between types ([
            Individual differences in the perception of visual illusions are stable across eyes, time, and measurement methods - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8164370/#:~:text=1976,judgments%20and%20distortions%20of%20parallelism)). That underscores that our normalization is not implying a common mechanism, only providing a common range.
- **Consistency and Repeatability:** repeated measures with the same observer should yield similar strength values (showing the metric reliably captures their perception). Studies have indeed found illusion magnitudes to be stable within individuals across time and testing methods ([
            Individual differences in the perception of visual illusions are stable across eyes, time, and measurement methods - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8164370/#:~:text=perception%20of%20visual%20illusions%20are,significantly%20predicted%20by%20visual%20acuity)).

Finally, these metrics would be useful for computational modeling: one could input an image of an illusion into an algorithm that simulates human vision and have it output a predicted “illusion strength” on 0–1 scale. By tuning the algorithm on known data (citations as above), we can attempt to **predict illusion strength from image parameters**. Each illusion type’s heuristic above provides guidance on what parameters (angles, ratios, contrasts, etc.) drive the score. The normalized outputs can then be compared, allowing us to rank illusions or test how modifications reduce the illusion (e.g., adding background lines might reduce the Checker Shadow score by giving more context cues).

In summary, each illusion’s strength can be captured by a **perceptual error measure** (length difference, angle offset, contrast match, motion equivalence, etc.), which we then scale to 0–1 based on the illusion’s typical range. By focusing on the point of subjective equality or equivalent perception ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10484025/#:~:text=The%20classic%20psychophysical%20method%20of,current%20study%2C%20to%20provide%20a)) ([

These measures, accompanied by proper validation experiments, give a consistent framework to quantify and compare the “illusion strength” of a wide variety of visual illusions.
